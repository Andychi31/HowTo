      <p title="Throwing the curveball.">
        When you throw the curveball, you have to throw it with a clockwise flick(for lefties, it's counter-clockwise.) Another way is throwing it while your arm is twisted clockwise(or counter-clockwise) relative to you. Flicking it will give your better results. However, as a beginner, I encourage you to keep your arm twisted clockwise(or counter-clockwise, if you are a lefty thrower.)<br>
        
        <ul title="Rules of throwing a curveball.">
          <li>Remember to keep your arm twisted when you follow through.</li>
          <li>Also, do not be afraid to let go of it kind of late, you want it do break low.</li>
          <li>Once you get better, you can add in the flick, the curveball will break even more.</li>
        </ul>

      <p title="How does the curveball break and curve.">
        Believe it or not, there is a lot of physics behind the curveball. I'm not much of a scientist, but I can say from what i have learned, that the flick from the throw, and the way the ball spins, causes the air around the ball to force it to break. I have seen an experiment done on a basketball that was spun, and the ball curved up and started flying, of course going down still.

      <p title="The Curveball.">
        The Curveball is a legendary pitch that has been around for decades. It does what it does through science. It is a hard pitch to learn, and an even harder pitch to master, but in the end it will get you very far. Especially when you need to strike someone out in a tough situation.  It is by the far the most used braking ball pitch in the mlb, and the most effective.
